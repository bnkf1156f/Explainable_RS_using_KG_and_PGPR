# Explainable_RS_using_KG_and_PGPR
This repository implements an Explainable Recommender System using the Policy-Guided Path Reasoner (PGPR) over a knowledge graph built from the MovieLens-1M dataset. The system not only recommends items but also generates concise, human-readable explanations derived from multi-hop reasoning paths.
